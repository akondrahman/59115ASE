Q-1: 
After running the modeling ISEE Player we see the following auxiliaries to be in between 0 & 1, so should we go ahead and assume that these auxiliaries are between 0 and 1? 

(1) Software_Development_Productivity
(2) Nominal_Errors_Committed_per_Task
(3) Average_#_Errors_per_Task 
(4) QA_Rate 
(5) Potential_Error_Detection_Rate 
(6) Actual_Rework_Manpower_Needed_per_Error 
(7) Daily_MP_for_Rework 
(8) Bad_Fix_Gen_Rate 
(9) Active_Error_Density 
(10) Testing_Rate 
(11) Passive_Error_Density  





Q-2: For the following  auxiliaries we did curve fitting based on some values provided by the model. Will that be okay? I have listed the names of the auxiliaries and their corresponding fitting functions below: 
(1) Multiplier_Due_To_Workforce_Mix : y = -x + 2 , R-Square = 1 
(2) Multiplier_Due_to_Schedule_Pressure : y = 0.2128x2 + 0.2955x + 0.9888, R-Square = 0.99933
(3) Fraction_Escaping_Errors_that_will_be_Active : y = -1.0286x2 - 0.2283x + 1.0719, R-Square = 0.91849
(4) Multiplier_to_Regen_Due_to_Error_Density : y = 0.828e0.0173x , R-Square = 0.9374
(5) Active_Errors_Retiring_Fraction : y = 0.0004e7.2984x , R-Square = 0.94991, if x >= 0.4, else 0 

Q-3: As part of the project we would like to minimize the following two objectives: 
a. Undetected active errors 
b. Undetected passive errors
