#### Keywords
* ii1: *performance*: authors "compare the *performance* of different models in terms of both traditional measures such as AUC and F-score, and the newer cost-effectiveness measures"

* ii2: *stability*: authors "compare the *stability* of prediction performance of the models across time and over multiple releases"

* ii3: *portability*: authors "compare the *portability* of prediction models: how do they perform when trained and evaluated on completely different projects?"

* ii4: *stasis*: authors "study *stasis*, *viz..*, the degree of change (or lack thereof) in the different metrics, and the corresponding models over time. [They] then releate these changes with their ability to prevent defects."
