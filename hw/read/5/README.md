#### Connection to the Initial Paper
Our selected initial paper titled *Ecological Inference in Empirical Software Engineering [2]* provided a conceptual framework on how prediction models can vary if metrics that are collected at aggregated with that of metrics collected at non-aggregated level. In this paper, the authors take a holistic approach, and discuss the global distributed model of software development, at different levels of separation and its effect on software quality.
