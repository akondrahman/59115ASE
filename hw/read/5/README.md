#### Keywords	 
* ii1: Classification : This term refers to the categorization of data values into discrete classes. For example, a binary classification will have two categories or classes - "YES" and "NO"
* ii2: Software Defect Prediction: This term refers to the process of identifying error prone software modules by means of data mining techniques. This helps in efficient allocation of resources to high-risk software segments. 
* ii3: Data Mining: It is a process of analyzing data from various sources and analyzing and deriving useful insights and patterns from the data , that can be used to make better decision in future.
* ii4: Statistical Methods: Statistics deals with the collection, interpretation, presentation and analysis of data. It offers various methods to estimate and correct for any bias within a sample and data collection procedures.

#### Connection to the Initial Paper
Our selected initial paper titled *Ecological Inference in Empirical Software Engineering [2]* provided a conceptual framework on how prediction models can vary if metrics that are collected at aggregated with that of metrics collected at non-aggregated level. In this paper, the authors take a holistic approach, and discuss the global distributed model of software development, at different levels of separation and its effect on software quality.
