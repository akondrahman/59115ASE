#### Keywords
* ii1: *Empirical Software Engineering*: "focuses on experiments involving software systems (software products, processes, and resources). The purpose of these experiments is to collect data that can be used to validate theories about the processes involved in software engineering [2]."
* ii2: *Fault Prediction*: To make "use of a plethora of structural measures in order to predict faults, even in
the absence of a fault history... Example structural measures include lines of code, operator counts, nesting depth, message passing coupling, information flow-based cohesion, depth of inheritance tree, number of parents, number of previous releases the module occurred in, and number of faults detected in the module during the previous release [3]."  Accurate fault prediction at an early stage of development, despite the lifecyle phase, allow for code to be fixed at a lower cost [3].
* ii3: *(Code) Inspection*: The practice of reviewing code for any defects or process improvements. May be performed by person, team of people, and/or a model built for fault detection.
* ii4: *Cross-Project Prediction*: "using data from one project to predict defects in another [1]."  As the title of the paper suggests, this is an imprecise practice.
