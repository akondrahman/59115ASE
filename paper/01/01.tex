Abstract—Software systems are decomposed hierarchically, for
example, into modules, packages and files. This hierarchical
decomposition has a profound influence on evolvability, main-
tainability and work assignment. Hierarchical decomposition is
thus clearly of central concern for empirical software engineering
researchers; but it also poses a quandary. At what level do we
study phenomena, such as quality, distribution, collaboration and
productivity? At the level of files? packages? or modules? How
does the level of study affect the truth, meaning, and relevance
of the findings? In other fields it has been found that choosing
the wrong level might lead to misleading or fallacious results.
Choosing a proper level, for study, is thus vitally important for
empirical software engineering research; but this issue hasn’t
thus far been explicitly investigated. We describe the related idea
of ecological inference and ecological fallacy from sociology and
epidemiology, and explore its relevance to empirical software
engineering; we also present some case studies, using defect and
process data from 18 open source projects to illustrate the risks
of modeling at an aggregation level in the context of defect
prediction, as well as in hypothesis testing.
